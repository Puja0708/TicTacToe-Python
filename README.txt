TicTacToe version 0.2
Tic tac toe written in Python.

To Run, Download file , open in 
shell as python tictac.py 

Works with usual rules, 
and determines a winner.The
motivation to make this was to learn python in 
a fun way.The AI is primitive for now in the sense
that it will select a random unoccupied tile.
Will update this in the coming days
